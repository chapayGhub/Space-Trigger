/*******************************************************************************
 This is a subclass of GameObject with two methodsâ€”an initializer, and a method
 that the ActionLayer will call every frame to give the BossShip time to do
 actions. It passes the position of the ship as a parameter, because the
 BossShip will want to know where the space ship is so it can shoot at it.
